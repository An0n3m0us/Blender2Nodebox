# Blender2Nodebox

Convert cubic Blender models to a Minetest nodebox model. Originally intended to be for making collision/selection boxes for OBJ models, but both can be done.

PLEASE DO NOT SCALE ANY OF THE OBJECTS. Manually make them smaller/bigger rather than scaling them.

# Instructions

1. Create your model

2. Select which objects you want to be exported

3. Press the Run Script button

In the directory of the Blender file, there will be a file called `blender.lua`. The model will be in there.

Here's a ![video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/An0n3m0us/Blender2Nodebox/master/other/1.mp4) demonstrating how to use it to create a collision/selection box.
